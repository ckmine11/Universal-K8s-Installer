## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- 🚀 **Zero-Install Gateway Agent**: The agent script now automatically bundles its dependencies into a single `agent-bundle.js` using `esbuild`.
- 💻 **Portable Node.js Auto-Download**: The PowerShell/Bash installation script now automatically downloads a portable Node.js v18.20.2 binary if Node is not installed on the system. No manual Node.js installation required!
- 🔄 **Agent Refresh Button**: Added a manual refresh button to the Registered Agents UI to quickly poll agent online status.

### Changed
- 🌐 **Localized Gateway UI**: Translated Gateway Agent connection instructions into easy-to-understand Roman Hindi to improve user comprehension.
- 🎨 **Simplified Settings**: Removed the "System Health" monitoring tab from the Settings page to keep the admin interface clean and focused strictly on cluster management.
- 🧹 **UI Cleanups**: Removed unnecessary dummy data, GitHub links, and "Engineered by" footers to provide a premium SaaS look.
- ⚙️ **Nginx Proxy Updates**: Updated the Nginx proxy rules to properly route requests for the newly bundled `agent-bundle.js`.
